# Course 2 premise:
---
    We are working with Blackwell Electronics' partner CreditOne. They are a third-party credit rating authority that issues credit to Blackwell's customers. 

    **Business questions:** 
        1. if each Blackwell customer can or cannot be approved for credit, 
        2. and if so, how much they can be approved for.

CreditOne needs an accurate way to make this decision because if the customer defaults, C1 has to pay the difference.
