### Course 2 premise:
    We are working with Blackwell Electronics' partner CreditOne. They are a third-party credit rating authority that issues credit to Blackwell's customers. 

    CreditOne wants to know if each Blackwell customer can or cannot be approved for credit, and if so, how much they can be approved for.

    CreditOne needs an accurate way to make this decision because if the customer defaults, C1 has to pay the difference.
    
### Course 2 Process Presentation File Summary:
    In this presentation, we will introduce the BADIR data science process framework and describe how each step will enable us to move forward toward this goal.
    
### Jupyter Notebook file:
    This file contains the work I have done towards solving the two problems listed in the Course 2 premise.
